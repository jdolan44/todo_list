# Rust To-do List
This is a simple to do list project using the Rust language.

My goal with this project is to better understand the use of structs in Rust, as well as built-in data structures such as the Vector type. Finally, one the project becomes large enough,
I plan to break it up into more isolated files using packages and modules.
